## About me
A Chinese high school student who likes programming. Still learning new things...

I belive technology can change the world. After learning something new, I'll write a blog post to share what I've learned (see [blog](https://blog.samhou.top/)).

I'm trying to use programming to solve some lifelong problems, such as keeping focus without distraction.

I usually have some crazy (sometimes useless) ideas, and some of them are turned into interesting projects, like [this](https://github.com/SamHou0/AutoVol).

## Other hobbies
- Play [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/32622349)
- Write novels and stories (usually *doujin*, like *fanfiction*)
- Watch anime and play visual novels (check [here](https://bgm.tv/user/samhou))
- Do some translation work
